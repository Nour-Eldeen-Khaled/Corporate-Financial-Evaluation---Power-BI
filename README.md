<h2>Business Impact</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    <ol>
<li>We need to investigate in our Support center and see why it has the lowest NPS among the different feedback categories  because we have the highest average NPS in our Product which means customers love our product but our support is the lowest which means that the customers may not buy from us again and it will have bad return on our sales.</li>
<li>We need to further investigate on the IT department and why it had the lowest AVG in the productivity Score.</li>
<li>We need to keep investing in Bonds because it is considered a safe and steady investment and it provided us with the highest AVG of ROI.</li>
<li>We see that investing in Stocks wasn’t the Right decision until now because the only 2 investments that we made in stocks scores at out least 3 investments by ROI in the company.</li>
<li>We need to see why the month November is considered one of the highest months in Energy Consumption and carbon emissions over Years.</li>
<li>There is a Weak positive correlation between Marketing investment and actual revenue, so we need to further investigate and see if there is any pending campaigns that its results will impact soon because as we saw earlier</li>
</ol>
